# DnD-character-randomizer
python code for generating random characters in DnD

Run randomChar for a random race, class, subclass and alignment.

Run randomCharNature to generate a character along with a random Pokemon nature.

Run batch_generate(int) to generate int random characters.

I mainly wrote this as a way to learn more about Python, I do not recommend using any characters generated with this code in actual DnD games.
